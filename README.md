# Instagram Reels Creation Optimization

## Project Overview
This project simulates a product analytics case study at Meta, and focuses on optimizing the Instagram Reels creation flow. The goal is to analyze user behaviour in the creation funnel, run an A/B test for a new "Quick Edit" feature, and provide data-driven recommendations.

## Key Questions
1. What are the drop-off points in the Reels creation funnel?
2. Does the "Quick Edit" feature improve the creation success rate?
3. Which user segments benefit the most?
4. What is the projected business impact?

## Data
For this project, sythentic data were simulated to mirror Meta's data structure, including:
- `users.csv`: User demographics and creator cohorts.
- `events_sample.csv`: Event logs of user interactions.
- `ab_test_results.csv`: A/B test results for the Quick Edit feature.
- `reels_performance.csv`: Performance metrics of posted Reels.
- `dau_metrics.csv`: Daily active user metrics.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Validation**: Check for missing values and data consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand user segments and event distributions.
3. **Funnel Analysis**: Calculate conversion rates and drop-offs in the creation flow.
4. **A/B Test Analysis**: Evaluate the impact of the Quick Edit feature with statistical tests.
5. **Business Impact Estimation**: Project the increase in Reels creation and watch time.
6. **Recommendations**: Provide a data-backed launch decision.
